<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are highly effective for automating electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis in atrial fibrillation (AF) detection, yet the challenge of analyzing variable-length ECG segments hinders consistent model performance. We introduce ECGBlocks, a method that combines block-based ECG segmentation with a stacked 1D-CNN architecture, enabling the extraction of rich localized feature maps and reliable AF classification via a softmax layer. Tested on three diverse datasets—PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2017, CPSC2018, and MIT-BIH AFDB—ECGBlocks achieved outstanding mean F1 scores: 85% (four-class), 87% (three-class), and 98% (binary) on CinC2017, with similarly high performance elsewhere. This work advances real-time single-lead ECG processing for efficient and accurate atrial fibrillation detection in wearable healthcare.</p>

<h2><a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.12785/ijcds/1501120" target="_blank">Mitigating Data Variability and Overfitting in Deep Learning Models for Atrial Fibrillation Detection Using Single-Lead ECGs</a></h2>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Deep learning for single-lead ECG-based AF detection often struggles with overfitting and data variability, especially in wearable ECGs with limited annotations. We propose Afib-CNN, a streamlined 1D CNN designed for short 9-second ECG recordings. Our framework applies advanced preprocessing—including MAConv filtering, min–max and z-score normalization—and uses a shifted-length overlapping method for data augmentation and class balancing. Validated on three public datasets (CinC2017, CPSC2018, MIT-AFIB), Afib-CNN reached mean F1 scores of 98%, 97%, and 99%, respectively, with 98% F1 on the CinC2017 test. This effective pairing of preprocessing and augmentation mitigates overfitting and ensures robust cross-dataset generalization, making it ideal for wearable ECG-based AF detection deployment.</p>
